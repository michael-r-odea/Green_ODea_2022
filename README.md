# Green & O'Dea et al 2021 scRNA sequencing data analysis
This repository contains R &amp; Python code for analyzing single-cell RNA sequencing data from Hammond et al. (2019) and Zhong et al. (2018) and generating figures for the Green &amp; O'Dea et al manuscript (in submission). 

Single-cell RNA sequencing data from Hammond et al. (2019) can be obtained from the NIH GEO database (GSE121654). Single-cell RNA-sequencing data from Zhong et al. (2018) can be obtained from the NIH GEO database (GSE104276). 

Requires R version ≥3.6. Python version 3.7 was used for generating stacked violin plots.
